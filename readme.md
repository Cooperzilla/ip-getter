# Ip Getter

This tells you your ip adress(ipv4 adress).

I made it because its anoying to look through what the ipconfig command prints out.

Use the ip.exe for it to print it in the terminal .

Or use the ip_gui_win.exe for a window to show with it(windows only).

Made very quickly with nim ***May not Work not tested much***.
