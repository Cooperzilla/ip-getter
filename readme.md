# Ip Getter

This tells you your ip address(ipv4 address).

I made it because its anoying to look through what the ipconfig command prints out.

Download and run the exe in the terminal to use.

Made with nim should work.

***Do not use the v1.0.0-alpha or v1.0.0-beta thoes version does not work***

v1.0.0-release will work
